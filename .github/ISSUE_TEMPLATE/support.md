# Stop!
React-Static does not use issues to track support requests. Please visit our [Official Support Community](spectrum.chat/react-static)! There, you can see existing discussions (which
 will likely solve your problem!) or ask a new question to the community. Yay!
 
 *If a support issue is opened, it will be **automatically closed** and you will receive the same message as above. If you believe you have discovered something that warrants an issue, please use a different template.*
